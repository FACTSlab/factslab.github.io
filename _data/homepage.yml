    FACTS.lab at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/) investigates (a) which of these conceptual categories can be related to which sorts of linguistic expressions, (b) what those relationships look like, and (c) how they can be leveraged for building better natural language understanding (NLU) systems.
