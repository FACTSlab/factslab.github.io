    description: "Lilia's research investigates the extent to which cognitive biases lead different languages to be represented and learned in the same way. She adopts a multi-method approach to understanding the nature of such biases, bringing together studies of adult semantic representation, cross-linguistic diversity, emerging sign languages and child language learning. She focuses on the domain of event semantics, particularly concepts related to agency, instrumentality and causation."

    description: "Aaron is interested in how the human ability to convey information about possible past, present, and future configurations of things in the world is undergirded by systematic relationships between intricately structured linguistic expressions and the dizzying array of conceptual categories available to humans. His research investigates (a) which of these conceptual categories can be related to which sorts of linguistic expressions, (b) what those relationships look like, and (c) how they can be leveraged for building better natural language understanding (NLU) systems."

    description: "Marty is in interested in the incremental representations that humans use to process language, and in differences between how language is used and how it is processed. To explore these topics, he studies the relationships between computational language models and psycholinguistic data (e.g., reading times), and he studies neural network representations of language to understand what aspects of language can be learned from language statistics directly without having experiences in the real world (i.e. through ungrounded learning)."

    title: Expectation-based Semantics in Language Comprehension
    abstract: The processing difficulty of each word we encounter in a sentence is affected by both our prior linguistic experience and our general knowledge about the world. Computational models of incremental language processing have, however, been limited in accounting for the influence of world knowledge. I present an incremental model of language comprehension that integrates linguistic experience and world knowledge at the level of utterance interpretation. Our model constructs--on a word-by-word basis--rich, distributed representations that capture utterance meaning in terms of propositional co-occurrence across formal model structures. These Distributional Formal Semantics representations are inherently compositional and probabilistic, capturing entailment as well as probabilistic inference. To quantify linguistic processing effort in the model, we adopt Surprisal Theory; in contrast with typical language model implementations of surprisal, our model instantiates surprisal as a comprehension-centric metric that reflects the likelihood of the unfolding utterance meaning as established after processing each word. I will present simulations that illustrate how the model captures processing effects from various semantic phenomena and how linguistic experience and world knowledge combine in determining online expectations. Finally, I will discuss implications of our approach for neurocognitive theories and models of language comprehension.
