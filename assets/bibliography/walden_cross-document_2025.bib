    abstract = "Event-keyed summarization (EKS) requires summarizing a specific event described in a document given the document text and an event representation extracted from it. In this work, we extend EKS to the cross-document setting (CDEKS), in which summaries must synthesize information from accounts of the same event as given by multiple sources. We introduce **SEAMuS** (**S**ummaries of **E**vents **A**cross **Mu**ltiple **S**ources), a high-quality dataset for CDEKS based on an expert reannotation of the FAMuS dataset for cross-document argument extraction. We present a suite of baselines on SEAMuS{---}covering both smaller, fine-tuned models, as well as zero- and few-shot prompted LLMs{---}along with detailed ablations and a human evaluation study, showing SEAMuS to be a valuable benchmark for this new task."
