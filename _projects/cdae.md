description: Cross-document information extraction and summarization, synthesizing information about events from multiple source documents.
text: |
  Understanding event descriptions is a central aspect of language processing, but current approaches focus overwhelmingly on single sentences or documents. Aggregating information about an event across documents can offer a much richer understanding of what happened, who was involved, and how different sources report on the same underlying facts. The Cross-Document Argument Extraction (CDAE) project develops methods and resources for extracting and synthesizing information about events from multiple source documents.

  A key challenge in cross-document event understanding is determining how to align and aggregate information across sources that may describe the same event differently or provide complementary details. This project addresses two main tasks: (i) cross-document argument extraction—identifying the arguments of events (who did what to whom, when, where, and why) across different accounts of the same event; and (ii) cross-document event-keyed summarization—generating coherent summaries of specific events by synthesizing information from multiple sources.

  CDAE is supported by a National Science Foundation collaborative grant ([BCS-2040831](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2040831)/[BCS-2040820](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2040820)) and the [Human Language Technology Center of Excellence](https://hltcoe.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University.
